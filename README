Notes about my modification to this module:

This requires that you also have the modified Frame.pm from https://github.com/raymondsteers/protocol-websocket 

Problem:
Since WebSocket messages are fragmentable, it's pretty easy for someone to create an attack if they can keep the fragment
payload below the default 65k and just send 128 frame fragments. That's an 8meg message that will block all other connection 
traffic. The max frames is settable in the frame module but inaccessable from this module. Even so, limiting it is 
problematic as you have no idea how a particular browser will fragment messages. Chrome starts fragmenting as soon as
messages are over 128k (131072 bytes to be exact), but this is not something you can rely on.

Solution:
A max message size enforcement that is more than just the number of frags times the payload. (A bad client 
can potentially vary each payload size easily so straight multiplication won't work)

Implementation:
my $ws = Net::WebSocket::Server->new(
    listen => $ssl_server,
    on_connect => sub {
        my ($serv, $conn) = @_;
	$conn->max_send_size(65536);# only affect OUTGOING messages from server to client
	$conn->max_recv_size(65536);# only affect INCOMING messages from client to server
	$conn->max_fragments(128);# only affect INCOMING messages from client to server
	$conn->max_mess_size(65536);# only affect INCOMING messages from client to server
        $conn->on(
            handshake => sub {
	    ....
